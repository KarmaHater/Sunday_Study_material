// + css is render blocking.  The DOM will not load until it is done.
// + delay rendering css that is not used until after the DOM is loaded
// + JS script pause dom constructions.
// + Anyc of defer  JS file that are not important so they do not block the critical render path.

// The page will only load once the html, css and js is loaded. Just then will it create the rendered tree and lastly create the layout and be painted.

// the 4 most important metrics are:
// - first meaningful paint - this is the first time the browser renders text or images
// - time to interactive - the first time the browser is fully interactive for at least 5 seconds
// - speed index - this is a formula based on visual completeness
// - performance score - also a formula based on a lot of metrics

// what you did might not impact any of these metrics
// the images are still loaded, but at a later time
// I think Lighthouse means image deferring as only loading them when the user scrolls down
